= n-doc: Creating CC Documentation with LaTeX

NOTE: This project is currently reorganized and all content is translated to
English. Not all files have been translated and there might be some
organizational errors.

This repository contains the developer documentation for the CC evaluation of
the Mauve VPN Client, a fictional TOE serving as a template for the
n-doc process. The developer documentation consists sample documents:

* Security Target (ASE)

* Functional Specification (ADV_FSP)

* TOE Design Specification (ADV_TDS)

* Test Coverage (ATE_COV)

* Security Architecture (ADV_ARC)

* Life Cycle (ALC)

* Reference List (Reflist)

Those documents provide an outline that can be used when adapting the sample
documents for your own purposes. Especially ASE, ADV_FSP and ADV_TDS contain
enough text to show the interaction between documents and database.

In 2021 the [Common Criteria Users Forum](https://www.ccusersforum.org) has
invited us to present n-doc at the 20th CCUF Workshop ([Presentation
slides](https://github.com/n-design/n-doc/files/8854636/CCUF_presentation_n-doc_AlexanderKrumeich.pdf)
and [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltZikycGoAs))


== Compiling the documents

Call `./runmake.sh` to build the documents. Result documents are copied
  to the directory `deliverables`.

`runmake.sh` starts a
link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ndesign/n-doc[ndesign/n-doc]
container. This container contains all the tools necessary for building the
documents. There is no need to install any software on your computer. The
current directory that contains the repository is mounted into the container:

----
docker run --rm  --volume $(pwd):/data ndesign/n-doc make -j4 delivery
----

Use a specific document type instead of `delivery` to build only a single
document (`ase`, `adv_tds` etc, see below) . The result document will be in the
subdirectory with the same name.

The optional parameter `-j` controls the number of threads  (jobs) that GNU Make
starts in parallel. Use the number of cores of your CPU. The more, the faster.

WARNING: Without a number after `-j` GNU Make uses all available resources of
the host system. This might lead to a complete standstill.


== Working on the docments / Structure of the repository

Each developer document has its own subdirectory. The subdirectories have the
same name as the document type: `ase`, `adv_tds` etc. All files that are
specific to that document type reside in that directory. Elements shared between
documents are in the `common` directory. Lua programs are in `lua`. The
`engine` subdirectory contains the resources needed to create the Docker image
containing TeX Live and all other tools. See the separate documentation in
link:engine/README.adoc[README.adoc] for details.

The documents are modularized. There is a main document that incorporates the
other parts. This main document must have the same name as the directory it
resides in, e.g. `adv_tds/adv_tds.tex`.

== Build-Management

The goal is to automate both the generation of PDF documents and the release
management as far as possible. A combination of tools is used for that:
link:http://personal.psu.edu/jcc8/software/latexmk-jcc/[`latexmk`],
link:https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[`make`] and an assortment of shell
scripts.

`latexmk` is used at the level of individual documents. To build several
documents at once, `latexmk` is combined with `make`.

The following goals are availavble at the root level `Makefile`:

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
| Goal      | Purpose

| `all`      | Creates all PDF-documents and the DB file in their respective directories

| `delivery` | Creates all PDF-documents and copies them to the directory `deliverables`. Documents are renamed so that they have their version number in the name.

| `ase`  | Creates the Security Target 

| `fsp` | Creates the  Funktional Specification (`adv_fsp`)

| `tds` | Creates the  Design Specification (`adv_tds`)

| `arc` | Creates the  Security Architecture (`adv_arc`)

| `ate` | Creates the  Test Coverage (`ate_cov`) 

| `ref` | Creates the  List of References (`reflist`)

| `clean` | Removes all documents and auxiliary files

| `mwe` | Creates the "minimal working examples" (`mwe_*`) and their `_body` files.

| `cleanmwe` | Removes all documents and auxiliary files for the minimal working examples

|===

The following shell scripts support the build management:

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
| Script | Purpose

| `scripts/release_documents.sh` | Creates a document release. Raises the version number and tags the repository.

| `scripts/renamereleases.sh` | _Not to be called by the user._ Adds the version number to the file name. Is called from the  `Makefile`.

| `scripts/create_release_archive.sh` | _Not to be called by the user._ Creates an archive with the documents in `deliverables`. Is called from the  `Makefile`.

== Collaborating with Others

=== Branching

All the work is done in feature branches. No direct pushes to the `main` branch
are accepted. Feature branches are spun off the `main` branch. Their names
should reflect the purpose, e.g. a ticket number or a short description such as
`fix-st-todos`. Sometimes it is helpful to prefix branch names with the editor's
name.

When a feature description is complete and the branch is pushed to the upstream
repository, the editor creates a pull request (Depending on the git server used
in the project, this is called either a _merge request_ or a _pull
request_. These terms mean the same thing.) The pull request is assigned to the
coordinating editor. They can review the changes and merge the changeset into
the `main` branch. To facilitate a clean repository structure, it is recommended
to _rebase_ the feature branch before accepting the pull request. This can be
done either by using `git rebase` or `git pull --rebase`. Both are acceptable
and it is a matter of personal taste which one is used.

=== Patch Workflow

Not all editors have access to the central git servers that host this document
repository. For external editors, who cannot directly push their changes to the
upstream repo, there is a patch workflow that is implemented by shell scripts.

Instead of pushing a branch and submitting a pull request, the external editor
creates a patch file that incorporates all commits of their feature branch. This
patch file is sent to the coordinating editor who will recreate the feature
branch by applying the patch file. They then create the pull request themselves.

To create a patch file, call `scripts/create-patch.sh` with the feature branch
 checked out. The script accepts a single optional argument `-f` or `--file`
 followed by a file name. If no file name is given, the script will use the
 branch name to derive a file name. In the patch file, every commit of the
 feature branch since the spin off from `main` has its own patch.

To process a patch file, call `scripts/process-patch.sh`. This script requires
the name of a patch file. With no other arguments, the script checks whether the
patch file can be applied to the `main` branch. It will also print the names of
the files that are modified by each commit in the patch file.

If called with `-a` (or `--apply`) the patch file is not only verified, but also
applied to the repository. A feature branch is created, the script derives the
branch name from the name of the patch file. The script can optionally be called
with the `-b` switch followed by a branch name.

It makes no sense to check commit the patch files. Files with the extension
`*.patch` are ignored in the `.gitignore` file.


== Release Management

Creating releases is described in a link:documentation/creating-releases.adoc[separate document].

== Minimal Working Examples

The directories `mwe_tds`, `mwe_st`, `mwe_fsp` and `mwe_arc` contain
documents that serve as __Minimal Working Examples__ (MWE, as is common at
link:https://tex.stackexchange.com/[TeX Stackexchange]). They provide the same
macros as their "bigger" counterparts and serve as test environments for
reproducing bugs or developing smaller chapters that are quicker to compile than
the ADV documents themselves. The main documents `mwe_tds/mwe_tds.tex`,
`mwe_st/mwe_st.tex` and `mwe_fsp/mwe_fsp.tex` should not be
modified. Instead, create a file `mwe_<documenttype>_body.tex` that can be
freely edited. This `_body` file is ignored by git so that there are no merge
conflicts that result from experiments. The make goal `make mwe` creates
`_body` files for all MWE-types.
